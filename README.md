# Fully Accessible and Interactive form

## Project Description

This project is an interactive form that uses various different methods of displaying information to the end user.
It is designed for an excellent user experience. Whether the user is unable to use a operate a computer in
a traditional sense, or trying to fill it to submit quickly. A good form should take into account
the overall usability of the page by displaying feedback dynamically. Instantly giving the user an idea of what they did right or
what they did wrong.

This form uses color and icons to display feedback allowing users that have impaired vision or are colorblind. 
All the required fields in the project validate the users input in real-time including the:


### Fields with Live Validation:

    * Name field
    * Email field
    * Activities section

Some of the real-time updating fields are not always visible on the page unless they are necessary.
More specifically:

### Additional Live Validation:

    * Credit Card number field
    * Card Expiration date field
    * Zip Code field
    * CVV field

## Additional Features

In addition to the Live validation process: 
***The email field*** possesses a special conditional message that displayswhether the user didn't format their email address properly or they forgot to fill it out at all.

***The activities section*** doesn't allow the user to register for events that have overlapping times. 

Additionally, the page will show the user a text field when they select the "*Other*" job role option. This field allows them to go into further detail about their title. This field is
only displayed when "*Other*" is selected.

And lastly, the ***T-Shirt info*** section only allows the user to select colors based on the shirt design chosen.
